# Issues

This page is intended to allow users to submit questions, feedback, bugs, feature requests, and other support inquiries about the app. Simply use the "Issues" tab on this GitHub page.

# About

Vijo is specifically useful in editing text files' contents directly in the app, allowing for quick notes to be taken and backed up instantly and viewing of text files that otherwise would have to be downloaded first or viewed in the browser.

Google Drive's mobile app does not allow for editing or viewing text files, and using Google's document types can be quite annoying on a small mobile screen. Additionally the navigation and other features of Vijo improve upon Google Drive's mobile app, and at any point you can open a file in Google Drive directly from the Vijo app.

# Additional Info

See the About page in the mobile application for complete details.
